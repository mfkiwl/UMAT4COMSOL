# UMAT4COMSOL
UMAT4COMSOL: An Abaqus user material (UMAT) subroutine wrapper for COMSOL
# Reference
S. Lucarini, E. Martinez-Paneda. UMAT4COMSOL: An Abaqus user material (UMAT) subroutine wrapper for COMSOL. Advances in Engineering Software, 2024.

# Descrition
UMAT4COMSOL is a C code developed by Sergio Lucarini that serves as an external material to be used in Comsol which calls an abaqus umat to compute mechanical constitutive equations.


Allows using abaqus umats in comsol easily
